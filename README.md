MVVM architecture with a simple dependency injection pattern, unit tests, custom app logo and search functionality.

## What was the reason for your focus? What problems were you trying to solve?
I was trying to create a simple architecture given the time constraints that was testable.

## How long did you spend on this project?
Around 5 hours

## Did you make any trade-offs for this project? What would you have done differently with more time?
Coordinators, an improved Network layer with cache management, proper localization, better design, modularization

## What do you think is the weakest part of your project?
The network and service layers could use some love, being more testable

## Is there any other information youâ€™d like us to know?
I couldn't be too creative given the time constraints and the amount of information I needed to add for every single row.
